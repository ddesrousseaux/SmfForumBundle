SmfForumBundle
==============

Symfony2 bundle for SMF Forums integration

This bundle uses the SMF rest API to cummunicate with any SMF Forum.
The goal is to work with the SMF datas into Symfony, and especially the user datas to provide a SSO authentication system based on SMF member table.

It is currently under development so feel free to contribute.
